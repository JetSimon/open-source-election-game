Though there is strife, and there is hardship, Jack Kennedy knows that when push comes to shove, the American people will choose hope, over fear - progress, over stagnation.</p>\n\nThis belief is helped, in no small part, by his campaign's deep coffers and smooth organisation. A chain store against a  sleuth of independent merchants, no campaign has the funds or cohesion to offer a serious challenge - save for Nixon's, in the general.</p>\n\nDemocrats across the nation turn out for Kennedy, and it seems that it will be a matter of how much he can win by, with no room for ifs.",
