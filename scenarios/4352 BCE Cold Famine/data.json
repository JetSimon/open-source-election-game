We have no physical evidence of their culture and infer mainly based on their influence on many languages and cultures of the modern day. As such this mod takes a lot artistic liberties depicting their culture and values. I have based as much as I can off of my research, but I am in no way claiming this to be the most accurate representation of PIE people.</p>",
