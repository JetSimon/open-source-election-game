Polk's annexation of the neighbouring Republic of Texas, and the war with Mexico it provoked, has heightened the slavery debate to its tensest levels yet. With Polk keeping his promise of a one-term presidency, Lewis Cass' ideal of \"popular sovereignty\" - that each territory and state should choose its status of slavery for itself - has taken the Democratic nomination. On the other side, an old Whig hero makes his last run at office - Henry Clay will take the mantle one more time, even if his odds are slim.<p></p>Lewis Cass holds a healthy lead in the minds of most Americans, including those who supported Clay's candidacy four years ago. The 'Great Compromiser' must chip away at Cass' lead, or else once again be right rather than President.",
