Chief clerk of the State legislature, chairman of the Young Republicans, state Senator, Lieutenant Governor, and federal Representative, one would imagine him to be a charming, ambitious man. This could not be further from the truth. Short, crowd averse, and suffering from a speech imepediment, Abdnor has found success because of his faults, not despite them. The man many expect Abdnor to be are the men the people of South Dakota are not. What he lacks in oration and wealth, he more than makes up for in his modesty, honesty, ability to compromise. His aw-shucks demeanor seems bizarrely out of place when juxtaposed against the national background.</p><p>The Republican Party seems poised to dominate the impending Congressional elections, even while Carter enjoys a polling advantage against the front-runner Ronald Reagan. For all intents and purposes, Abdnor simply must stay on this side of the soil to win this election, or at least that's what he's been told. Sure, he enjoys numerous advantageous, but he's been around in South Dakota politics for long enough not to count George out too soon. Despite his <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</em> persona, Abdnor has no intention of impeding the conservative firestorm brewing against his opponent. South Dakotans deserve a Senator who truly represents them, and who better than a pro-life former farmer with an R next to his name?</div></div></div>",

George Cunningham, Bill Dougherty, and Eleanor McGovern-- the three people who can truly say they hold McGovern's ear. Cunningham, a trusted legislative aide with a wonkish bent, serves mostly as an advisor to his boss, doing what he can to keep the McGovern message clear, consistent, and palatable to his constituents. Dougherty, battle tested on the national scene from the '72 campaign and from his own attempts at state office, runs campaigns in his sleep, although usually to meager success. And finally, principle among them, Eleanor McGovern. Not one for the political spotlight, Elanor is nonetheless supportive of her husband and his endeavors. While others in the court of King George want to propel him onwards and upwards, Elanor keeps him grounded.</p><p>Left largely to fend for themselves by the party apparatus more focused on races they deem winnable, the McGovern Office must do what they've always done-- the impossible. Mobilizing an effective ground game, countering notions of the Senator's apathy and political distance to South Dakota, and raising enough money to counter the deluge of funds pouring in from outside organizations will put the staff to the test like they've never faced before.</p>",

We're interested in ideology. We're not interested in respectability.</em>\"<br>- John <q>Terry</q> Dolan, co-founder of the National Conservative Political Action Committee</p><p>The National Conservative Political Action Committee is a caged beast champing at the bit for blood. Unashamedly disinterested in politics as usual, NCPAC is unabashedly crude, graceless, and scarily effective. Innovative and cunning, NCPAC co-founder Terry Dolan was among the first to exploit the loopholes created in the landmark Buckley v. Valeo ruling, which held that PACs were limited to $10,000 per candidate, but placed no such restriction so long as the organization was not in direct coordination with the candidate. Such politicking created an impregnable barrier for NCPAC-aligned candidates to hide behind as bombastic and detestable ads and leaflets came at the hands of NCPAC, not the candidate. The effectiveness of such a method was proven as Dick Clark, the junior Democratic Senator from Iowa, was buried so deep under NCPAC mail and leaflets, not even his 30% poling lead could save him from defeat in 1978. So what hope then is there for George McGovern?</p><p>South Dakota is a state fundamentally opposed to the baby-murdering practice of abortion, unsympathetic to kowtowing to Moscow under the veneer of arms control, averse to efforts to amend the Constitution to put men and women in the same bathroom, and just about everything else George McGovern stands for. Dolan has taken a unique interest in the South Dakota Senate race, eager to unseat the champion of liberalism, even more so than the Republican nominee. Dolan's willingness to play dirty is antithetical to the timid and personable Abdnor, but the money spends all the same. There is no subject too taboo, no angle of attack too uncouth, no word too inflammatory if it brings about the defeat of George McGovern and the Senate liberals. </div></div></div>",

Tens of thousands of active duty, reservists, and National Guardsmen not only work in South Dakota-- they vote. You've been an outspoken critic of the B1 bomber- an aircraft poised to be stationed in Ellsworth prior to its cancellation- as well as the MX missile, leading many to take you as weak on defense. Are they right?\n",

With that in mind, I've had ample time to review additional arguments and to personally speak to some experts in the field. I could see myself supporting a new kind of bomber, a son of a B1 to say. Something more field-ready and cost efficient.",

              "feedback": "Few things are as toxic in South Dakota as a concurrence with President Carter, but speaking out against the B1 might be one of them. Hedging with an appeal to cost and inadequacy and throwing your support behind a hypothetical B1-B might be all you can do. The response is certainly awkward, but positional evolutions happen all the time.\n\n",

The value of the dollar has plummeted such that everyday expenses threaten to bankrupt the working family.

Tehran's newly seated Islamic Republican government threatens to upend the tentatively held Middle Eastern order. America is a nation scarred by the tumultuous two decades previous, and by and large, blames the Democratic Party for its fall from grace.</p><p>As the Presidential Election of 1980 nears, Terry Dolan and the National Conservative Political Action Committee have marked five incumbent Democratic Senators for death. Vowing to do whatever necessary to upend the liberal order which brought America from the prosperity of the 50's and hope of the 60's to the despair of the 70's, a Republican revolution seems inevitable.</p>",
