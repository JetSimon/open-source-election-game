Polk, the Democrat, gained his nomination by favoring the measure. Henry Clay, the Whig, has more latitude.</p><p>The Liberty Party lurks as an abolitionist third party, and will pressure the Whigs. Conversely, John Tyler hopes to use the Texas issue to energize an independent campaign, if Polk wavers. Other campaign issues are tariffs, internal improvements, and the banking system.</p>",
