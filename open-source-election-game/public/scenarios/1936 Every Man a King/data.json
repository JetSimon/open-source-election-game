Surviving an assassination attempt in 1935, he narrowly secured the Democratic Nomination for this election after Roosevelt's death and Garner's refusal to seek a full term. A tense and confused convention, still reeling from the loss of such an iconic figurehead, choose to nominate the controversial but upstart candidate that is Huey Long.</p><p>Long promises to reform the very popular New Deal policies, arguing Roosevelt has not gone far enough, in what he calls the 'Share Our Wealth' programs. If passed, these programs could radically transform the economy. To win, Long can either reconcile with the party establishment, or go all in on his Share Our Wealth programs. Long must also defend his record as Governor of Louisiana, and be careful that the skeletons don't come creeping out of the closet...</p>",

A tense and chaotic Democratic Convention nominated Huey Long on the 30th ballot. Meanwhile, the Republican Party, still reeling from brutal losses in 1932 and 1934, have backed Alf Landon, a moderate Republican governor of Kansas.</p><p>Senator Long must unite the New Deal Coalition to defeat Landon. Alf Landon may have to win the support of some of the Democratic Establishment under a “Anyone but Huey Long” coalition.<p>",
